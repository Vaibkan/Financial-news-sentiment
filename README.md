# Financial-news-sentiment
I created a financial news sentiment analyzer that analyzes the sentiment of news article topics of any cmpany ticker over the past 38 days from finviz. I used Beautiful Soup's web html parsing that gathers only the news segment of the website. I also used finvader's sentibignomics and henry dictionaries to gather financial sentiments.
